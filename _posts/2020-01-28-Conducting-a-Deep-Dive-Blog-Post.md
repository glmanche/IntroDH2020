For our first discussion, we talked about doing a deep dive. We read the articles "Data Biographies: Getting to Know 
Your Data" by Heather Krause, and "The Route of a Text Message, a Love Story" by Scott Weingart, as well as Thomas 
Thwaites's book "The Toaster Project". Each of these readings showed us something different about in-depth analysis.
The "Data Biographies" piece gave us some background on what is important to know about your data, such as knowing where
it came from, why it was collected, and who collected it. "The Toaster Project" and "The Route of a Text Message" were two
very different examples of deep dives; one about the inner workings of a toaster, about the magic behind a text message.

We started by discussing what is most important to know about your data; the who vs. where vs. when vs. how vs. why, and if
any one is more important than another. I also asked the group if knowing how something works is inharently important to using
it (like knowing how a texts works to be able to send a text, for example). Talking about the different parts and people needed
in sending a text led us to conversations about the people, materials, and money involved in building a toaster.


Gayathri Response:
I really enjoyed this session and I thought you did a really good job of discussing it! I liked how we talked about the what vs. why and I think it led to some powerful insights within the realm of collecting data. I also think we had interesting discussions regarding innovation and why we need to learn the inner workings of technology or anything else for that matter.
