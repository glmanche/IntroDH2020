The below schedule is *tentative* and *evolving*. Reading option lists will be culled by the instructor and the session's student leader down to a cap of about 120 pages of reading due for Wednesday sessions, and a cap of about 50 pages for Friday sessions. Readings may be added that are not already in the list of reading options. Course topics may change with a few week's notice, and the reading list will be finalized at least a week in advance.

*[note: some of the DH Debates and other citation links point to the wrong place. Will fix soon.]*

Session Leader: Sabrina

### Leader Notes
- In "Data Biographies: Getting to Know Your Data," Heather Krause states that the most important part of getting to know your data is finding out the **why** (i.e. why was it collected?) Do you agree? Is the why more important than the where, who, or how? Is any one of these more important than another?
- Is knowing how things work a necessary part of using them?
  - Knowing how a clock works vs. being able to tell time

## 1/24 - 3. Google Books and Culturomics
Session Leader: Gayathri

### Leader Notes
- Culturomics is a way to analyze writing to find patterns in that shed light on human behavior and culture trends.
- We can see how this can shed light on the evolution of grammar, adoption of technology, pursuits of technology, etc…
- Sharp declines in author’s names of words can mean there was censorship
- Limitations of google books: (1) contains only 5-6% of all books published, (2) OCR errors
- ngrams looked at:
   coffee, tea
   smelly Indian, smart Indians, smart Whites, entitled Whites
   burned, burnt
   cocaine, LSD, heroin, marijuana, meth, opium
   country, family, God

## 1/31 - 5. History of Book Scanning & Google Books
Session Leader: Jaclyn

### Leader Notes
-How much was reputation a factor in the inception and process of the UM-Google Cooperative Agreement? 
- How did “librarian culture” (collectivist, rooted in tradition, egalitarianism,) impact this project, and how to what extent do you think this impacts the broader scope of digitization projects? What might be a reason some librarians are so open to the idea of digitization, while others are not? 
-From the article, https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/13/an-elephant-backs-up-googles-library/. Do you agree with the commenters about the potential outcomes of this project? 12 years later, has this affected library culture now? 
-It digitization a tool for librarians, or is going to make librarians obsolete? 
-(Million Books Project) Journalist Kevin Kelly notes, “The desire of all creators is for their works to find their way into all minds.”He believes there is a moral imperative to scan, and notes that Amazon is busily scanning the four million books in its inventory.” To what extent do you agree or disagree with Kelly?

## 2/5 - 6. Ngram Interfaces and their Affordances
Session Leader: Shambhavi

### Leader Notes

- Design Article Questions to Consider: 
  - What technologies or designs have you interacted with that have high functionality, but low design aesthetic? 
  - What technologies or designs have you interacted with that have high design aesthetic, but low functionality? 
  - How can we tie the econological approach to digital humanities? (specifically in corpus engine search design)
  - In relationship to types of affordances, how are objects designed for active exploration, and how are those types of designs better or worse? In other words, how much responsibility can we put on the user to pay attention to certain details in order to operate an object, and how much responsibility is placed on the designer? 
  - When designing, are there situations where you can give too much information? How does the user react in these situations and what type of affordances do they typically interact with that stimulate an overwhelming sensation? 
  
- State of the Union Article Questions to Consider: 
  - What are the design/user-interface implications of setting up an interactive chart like so? What works and what doesn't, and more importantly, what type of story is being shared and what information is being ignored/omitted? 
  - What was the most interesting term and trend that you observed? What surprised you or didn't surprise you? 
  - When looking at words such as "war", "her", and "currency" what does the trend say about language changing over time? 
  - What words do you think should have been included into this study? 
  - Take a look at a similar map that is an interactive design to compare : [https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/01/mapping-the-state-of-the-union/384576/] (https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/01/mapping-the-state-of-the-union/384576/) 
  
-Interactive databases (Peachnote/HathiTrust/Gendered Language/BYU corpora) Questions to Consider: 
  - What was the purpose of each database? 
  - What was an interesting example/comparision you found? or  What were some common trends that you observed? 
  - Where there any design interface issues/difficulties? or Where there any technology issues/difficulties?

## 2/7 - 7. Digital Labor
Session Leader: Chloe

### Leader Notes
- Digitizing Labor in the Google Books Project (Andrea Zeffiro)
  - Thesis: Digital infrastructure and its failure to work, including glitches in its functioning, may prompt reflections about its material origins. “When assembled together, the audiovisual traces, glimmers, residues and specks of the ScanOps produce an archive that is, in effect, a counter-archive to the Google Book Project” (134).
  - Objective: Unpack the “unintended but valuable consequence of digitizing millions of texts [because this] is the digitization of the process of labor itself” (137).
  - The audiences is “scholars on all levels” with the hope that they will “reflect on who and what contributes to the material sustenance of our research practices and processes of knowledge production” (148).
- Producing “one vast index”: Google Book Search as an algorithmic system (Melissa K Chalmers and Paul N Edwards)
  - Thesis: “Here we take a new tack, arguing that Google’s approach to digitization was shaped by a confluence of technical and cultural factors that must be understood together” (2).
  - “Algorithmic digitization” is proposed in order to describe Google’s commitment to scale, standardization processes, and automation, which beyond scaling up Google’s algorithmic digitization effort, in fact has the effect of “reimagining” the intended outcomes of their project as well as “contributing important implications for mediating digital access to print books” (2).
  - Objective: Examine the ways that labor, partnerships, goals, and algorithms contribute to seeing books as data and objects for searching and discovery rather than simply reading. “This project seeks to join an existing critique oriented toward material culture and labor process with an emerging critique of algorithmic culture. ‘Algorithmic digitization’ thus serves us as a sensitizing concept emphasizing relationships between inputs, materials, labor, processes, outputs, use, and users. We use it here to consider opportunities and limitations in Google’s approach to providing universal access to information” (13).
  - The audience is a wide variety of scholars and readers, especially those in information science and studies.

- Questions:
- Before learning about Google’s secret book scanning process, did you have a preconceived idea of how the scanning process worked? Did it involve machines or human labor?
- Google imagines information from books as necessarily searchable and discoverable rather than readable. What might this orientation towards digitized books mean for a searcher or researcher?
- What do we think the stakes are for the “lost” information through Google’s digitization process (such as the physical size, weight, color, texture, or structure of a book?)
- What about information “gained” such as Google’s logo as an embedded trace, or perhaps other material traces such as fingers digitized over the text?
- For people interested in history, anthropology, literary studies, cultural studies, or other fields, why might visiting physical archives with analog books be important even though the textual information may be digitized and accessible online?

## 2/28 - 13. History of Computing & Human Information Technology
Session Leader: Sabrina

### Leader Notes
- Pre-discussion question: does anyone know where the term "computer" came from?
  - The term "computer" originally referred to a person, usually a woman, who would enter data, complete calculations, etc. Thruoughout history, women have been behind major achievements and advancements in many fields. 
  - Women were believed to be more careful than men and employers could pay women less (especially women of color)
  - https://twitter.com/yungaccident/status/1232147792942043136
- A Queer History of Computing
  - "In his biography of Alan Turing, Andrew Hodges writes of the love letter generator, that '[t]hose doing real men’s jobs on the computer, concerned with optics or aerodynamics, thought [it] silly, but [...] it greatly amused Alan and Christopher.'"
    - Implies that Alan and Cristopher weren't doing "real men's jobs on the computer"
    - Is the love letter generator considered to be a bigger feat in art or (computer) science?
- When Computers Were Women
  - Was anything in this reading surprising?
  - This was a particularly satisfying read for me because I know that women have been erased in achievements such as these but I didn't have specific detailed examples
- Female Punch Card Operatives
  - "poetical science" - when a straight man makes it it's science, but if a woman/homosexual makes it then it's art
  - Busa chose women, specifically women who were unfamiliar with Latin, because he believed that they would be more careful than men (especially men familiar with Latin)
  - Do the opportunities/success this project brought for these women make up for the fact that they recieved no credit?
    - The women recieved training and job experience; "industries wanted to hire them before they had finished the program." ... "they secured excellent jobs once they had completed the course, and often before."
    - Were you surprised to learn that companies were not just willing, but eager to hire women?
